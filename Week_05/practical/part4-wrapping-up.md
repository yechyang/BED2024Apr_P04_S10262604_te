## Wrapping Up: Building the View for Your Books API

In the past three steps, we've successfully created a front-end view for your Books API using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript integrated with your Express application. Here's a summary of what we accomplished:

1. **Setting Up the Front-End Project Structure:** We created a folder named `public` within your Express project to hold the front-end view files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). This separation helps organize your project for better maintainability.

2. **Configuring Express for Static File Serving:** We modified your Express application's main JavaScript file (`app.js`) to configure static file serving. This allows the browser to access the front-end view files you created in the `public` folder. Essentially, Express handles serving these static files when requested by the browser.

3. **Building the View with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:** We created separate files for HTML (`index.html`), CSS (`styles.css`), and JavaScript (`script.js`) within the `public` folder.
   - The `index.html` file defines the basic structure of your view, including sections for the title and the book list.
   - The `styles.css` file provides styles to format the UI elements, creating a visually appealing layout for the book list.
   - The `script.js` file utilizes JavaScript's Fetch API to retrieve book data from your Books API. It then dynamically creates HTML elements and populates them with the retrieved book information, updating the content within the `#book-list` section.

This concludes the core functionality of building a view to display book data from your API.

**Challenge Yourself! (Optional)**

While this practical focused on displaying book information, you can extend this view to allow users to create, update, and delete books by implementing additional features:

- Create forms to capture user input for new book titles and authors. Submitting these forms would involve sending data to your Books API using methods like POST (create) and PUT (update).
- Implement functionality to display individual book details when a user clicks on a specific book in the list.
- Allow users to delete books from the list by providing a delete button or functionality. This would involve sending a DELETE request to your Books API to remove the corresponding book.

By implementing these additional features, you'll enhance the functionality of your view and create a more interactive user experience for managing book data within your Books API application.
