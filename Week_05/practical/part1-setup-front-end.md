## Step 1: Setting Up the Front-End Project Structure (books-api-mvc-db Project)

This step involves creating the necessary folder structure within your existing `books-api-mvc-db` project from Week 4 to hold the front-end files that will constitute the view for your Books API.

1. **Navigate to Project Directory:**

   - Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you have your `books-api-mvc-db` project saved.

2. **Create the `public` Folder:**

   - Use the `mkdir` command to create a new folder named `public` within your project directory. This folder will serve as the root directory for all your front-end view files.

   ```bash
   mkdir public
   ```

3. **Organize Your View Files:**

   - Inside the `public` folder, you can create additional subfolders for better organization, separating your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Here's a common structure:

   ```
   books-api-mvc-db
        public/
            - index.html  (Main HTML page for the view)
            - styles/
                - styles.css  (Styles for the user interface)
            - scripts/
                - script.js  (JavaScript logic for fetching data and DOM manipulation)
        controllers/
        middlewares/
        models/
        ...
   ```

   You can adjust this structure based on your preference or project complexity. However, for this practical, having separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is sufficient.

We'll continue building the view for your Books API in the next steps, utilizing Express's static file serving to integrate it seamlessly with your existing back-end functionalities.
