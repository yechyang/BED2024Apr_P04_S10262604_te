## Step 2: Updating app.js for Static File Serving

In this step, we'll modify your Express application's main file (`app.js`) to configure static file serving. This allows the browser to access the front-end view files you'll create in the next step.

1. **Import the `express.static` Middleware:**

   Open your `app.js` file and locate the section where you import required modules for your Express application. Include the following line to import the `express.static` middleware:

   ```javascript
   const express = require("express");
   // ... other import statements
   const app = express();
   // ... other app setup

   const staticMiddleware = express.static("public"); // Path to the public folder
   ```

2. **Mount the Static Middleware:**

   Locate the section in `app.js` where you define routes and middleware for your application. Typically, this would be after importing required modules and setting up the Express app instance. Use the `app.use` method to mount the imported `staticMiddleware` with the path to your `public` folder:

   ```javascript
   // ... existing code

   // Include body-parser middleware to handle JSON data
   app.use(bodyParser.json());
   app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true })); // For form data handling

   app.use(staticMiddleware); // Mount the static middleware

   // ... existing route implementation for your Books API
   ```

**Explanation:**

By mounting the `staticMiddleware` using `app.use`, you configure Express to serve static files from the `public` directory. When a user requests a URL that maps to a file within the `public` folder (e.g., `/index.html`, `/styles/styles.css`), Express locates the file and sends it directly to the browser. This simplifies your code by offloading the responsibility of serving static content to Express.

**Note:** The code snippet assumes you already have existing route definitions for your Books API in `app.js`. These routes remain unaffected and will continue to function as intended.

Now that Express is configured for static file serving, we can proceed to Step 3, where we'll create the actual view files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) within the `public` folder to display book information retrieved from your Books API.
