## Week 03: Building a Books API with MVC in Node.js and Express

**Practical Title: Building a Robust CRUD API with MVC, Validation, and Error Handling in Node.js and Express**

**Learning Objectives:**

1. **Implement MVC Architecture:** Gain practical experience applying the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to structure a Node.js and Express application for clear separation of concerns.
2. **Input Validation Middleware:** Develop reusable middleware to validate user input during CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, ensuring data integrity and robustness.
3. **Centralized Error Handling:** Implement error handling middleware in the main entry point (`app.js`) to capture and provide informative error responses for a user-friendly API.

**Prerequisites:**

- Familiarity with Node.js and Express fundamentals (modules, routes, request/response cycle)
- Understanding of CRUD operations
- Intermediate knowledge of Javascript

**Duration:**

2 hours (depending on student pace)

**Software Required:**

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system
- Text editor or IDE of your choice

**This practical builds upon the previous session, where you explored the MVC architecture and implemented basic CRUD operations in Node.js and Express. Now, we'll enhance the application by adding input validation and centralized error handling.**
