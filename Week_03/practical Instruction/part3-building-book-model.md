## Step 3: Building the Book Model and Understanding Classes and Models (45 mins)

**3.1. Classes in JavaScript and the Model in MVC:**

Before diving into the code, let's understand the concepts of classes and the role of the Model in MVC:

- **Classes in JavaScript:** Classes are a blueprint for creating objects. They define properties (data) and methods (functions) that objects of that class will have. JavaScript doesn't have traditional classes like other languages (Java, C++), but it simulates them using prototype-based inheritance.

- **The Model in MVC:** In the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, the Model represents the data and business logic of your application. It's responsible for:
  - Managing data (retrieval, manipulation, storage)
  - Defining data structures (like the `Book` class)
  - Encapsulating data access logic (e.g., database interaction)

**3.2. Creating the `Book` Model (models/book.js):**

Now, let's create the `Book` model file:

1. **Create a file named `book.js` inside the `models` directory.**

2. **Define the `Book` Class:**

```javascript
class Book {
  constructor(id, title, author) {
    this.id = id;
    this.title = title;
    this.author = author;
  }

  // ... methods for CRUD operations (explained later)
}

module.exports = Book;
```

**Explanation:**

- The `Book` class defines the structure of a book object.
- The `constructor` function is called when you create a new `Book` instance. It takes arguments like `id`, `title`, and `author` and assigns them to the object's properties.
- We'll define methods for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) within the `Book` class in the next step. These methods will interact with data (currently simulated in-memory, later connected to a database).

**Remember:**

- The `Book` class serves as a template for creating book objects with specific properties and functionalities.
- It represents the data aspect of the MVC pattern, encapsulating the structure and logic related to book data.

**Here are some helpful references for understanding Classes in JavaScript and the Model in MVC:**

**Classes in JavaScript:**

- **Official JavaScript Documentation - Classes:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/class) provides a detailed explanation of classes in JavaScript, including syntax, inheritance, and methods.
- **JavaScript.info - Classes:** [https://javascript.info/classes](https://javascript.info/classes) offers an interactive tutorial and clear explanations on JavaScript classes with examples.
- **MDN Web Docs - Prototypal Inheritance:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain) dives deeper into the concept of prototypal inheritance, which is the foundation for classes in JavaScript.

**Model-View-Controller (MVC):**

- **Wikipedia - Model-View-Controller:** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) provides a general overview of the MVC design pattern, its components, and benefits.
- **A Gentle Introduction to MVC:** [https://www.tutorialspoint.com/asp.net_mvc/index.htm](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/asp.net_mvc/index.htm) offers a practical guide to understanding MVC with clear diagrams and explanations.
- **MVC Tutorial for Beginners:** [https://www.w3schools.in/mvc-architecture](https://www.w3schools.in/mvc-architecture) showcases a basic MVC implementation using JavaScript to illustrate the separation of concerns.

These resources should provide a solid foundation for understanding classes in JavaScript and the role of the Model in MVC. Feel free to ask if you have any further questions!

**Next Steps:**

In the following step, we'll implement the CRUD methods within the `Book` class to demonstrate how the model interacts with data.
