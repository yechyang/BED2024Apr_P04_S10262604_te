## Practical Title: Building a CRUD REST API with Node.js and Express

## Practice Duration: 2 hours

### Introduction:

This practical session will introduce you to Node.js, Express, and the concept of building a simple RESTful API.

We will be building an API for managing a library of books using Node.js and Express. The API will allow us to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books.

We will be using an in-memory array to store book data instead of a database for simplicity.
