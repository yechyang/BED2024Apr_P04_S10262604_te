## Week 6 Practical Summary: Expanding User Management with Books Functionality

This practical focused on extending a user management system beyond basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. We explored how to combine functionalities from different models and controllers to achieve a more comprehensive user experience.

**Key Learnings:**

- **Search Functionality:** Implemented a search function for users based on search terms.
- **Data Access with Joins:** Used SQL joins in the User model to retrieve user information along with book details from related tables.
- **Model Enhancements:** Extended the User model with methods like `getUsersWithBooks`
- **Controller Enhancements:** Created new functions in the Users controller to handle user requests (e.g., `/users/with-books`).
- **MVC Approach:** Discussed the benefits of using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern for separating data access (model), request handling (controller), and presentation (view).

**Benefits:**

- Improved user experience: Users can easily manage their accounts and see books in one place.
- Modular and maintainable codebase: Clear separation of data access logic and request handling.
- Reusability of components: Controllers can leverage functionalities from multiple models.
- Scalability and future-proofing: Easier to integrate new features by reusing existing models and controllers.

**Optional Challenges:**

- Implement functionalities for adding and removing books from users.

**Future Practicals**

- Explore user authentication and authorization for secure access.

This practical demonstrates how to build a more robust user management system that caters to evolving requirements and needs as the application grows. By combining functionalities and following best practices, you can create applications that are user-friendly, maintainable, and scalable.
